# 📖 Restaraunt Meal (JS Capstone Group Project) <a name="about-project"></a>

**Restaraunt Meal (JS Capstone Group Project)** is a JavaScript capstone project about building a web application based on an external API. We selected the Meals API that provides data about meals we like and then built the webapp around it. The webapp has 3 user interfaces:
- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.
